# README Generator

## Description
This is a simple program that will allow a user to generate a quick, simple README template using their responses to certain prompts. It is largely reliant on the Inquirer and Fs libraries in Node and Javascript to function.
Simply edit in the file in VSCode and open the file in the integrated terminal. Then use node to execute it. The prompts will appear.

This was a cool project, and served as a great way for me to grow familiar with the Inquirer functionality, as well as .then and using the response variable. 
It was also kinda weird using a giant string literal to implement user responses, but I figured it out.
Attached is a video demonstrating:
